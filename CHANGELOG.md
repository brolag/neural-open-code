## [1.7.0] - 2026-02-03

### Agentic Engineering Framework Release

Major update introducing comprehensive agentic coding measurement and optimization tools.

### Added

#### CRAFT Framework (`/craft`)
Structured prompt engineering framework for autonomous agent tasks:
- **C**ontext - Current situation and constraints
- **R**equirements - Success criteria and objectives
- **A**ctions - Allowed/forbidden operations with 3-tier boundaries
- **F**low - Execution steps and iteration strategy
- **T**ests - Verification and completion signals

Includes:
- 6 Core Areas checklist (Commands, Testing, Structure, Style, Git, Boundaries)
- 3-Tier Boundary System (✅ Always / ⚠️ Ask first / 🚫 Never)
- Integration with `/loop --craft` for autonomous sessions

#### KPI Tracking Skill (`/kpi`)
Track the 4 core metrics of agentic coding performance:
- **Plan Velocity** - Time from intent to actionable spec
- **Review Velocity** - Time per code review cycle
- **Autonomy Duration** - Time agents work without intervention
- **Loop State** - Distribution across In-Loop/Out-Loop/ZTE

```bash
/kpi                     # Dashboard
/kpi autonomy 45 "Task"  # Log session
/kpi report              # Weekly report
```

#### Compute Advantage Calculator (`/ca`)
Calculate your agentic leverage with the Compute Advantage formula:

```
CA = (Compute Scaling × Autonomy Duration) / (Time + Effort + Monetary Cost)
```

Interpretation:
- < 2.0 = Break-even
- 2.0-5.0 = Good leverage
- 5.0-10.0 = Excellent
- > 10.0 = Elite (ZTE-level)

#### Cost Tracker Skill (`/cost`)

### OpenCode v2.1.x Integration - Hidden Patterns Release

Major feature release implementing 10 breakthrough patterns discovered by synthesizing OpenCode v2.1.x features with Neural OpenCode architecture.

### Added

#### Research Swarm (`/research-swarm`)
Parallel forked research agents using `context: fork` for true cognitive isolation.
- Launch 3-5 parallel research agents simultaneously
- Each agent explores independently without context contamination
- Synthesize findings into comprehensive report
- Best for: broad research, competitive analysis, multi-angle exploration

#### Parallel Multi-AI Verification Mesh (`/pv-mesh`)
Combines AlphaGo-style parallel verification with true AI diversity.
- Run Claude, Codex, and Gemini in parallel forks (single message, 3 Task calls)
- Each AI uses its unique strengths (Claude: accuracy, Codex: terminal, Gemini: algorithms)
- 3x faster than sequential `/ai-collab` (15-20s vs 45-60s)
- Best for: architecture decisions, complex debugging, security reviews

#### Teleport Memory Bridge (`/teleport-sync`)
Synchronize memory state between local CLI and cloud (opencode.ai) sessions.
- `export` - Pack memory into portable JSON blob for clipboard
- `import` - Unpack memory blob back to local files
- `status` - Check sync state
- Best for: hybrid execution (local work → cloud web access → return with results)

#### Expertise Watcher Script (`scripts/expertise-watcher.sh`)
Self-improving agent mesh infrastructure using fswatch.
- Watches `.opencode/expertise/*.yaml` for changes
- Broadcasts updates to all active agents via systemMessage injection
- Queues changes for next session consumption
- Usage: `./expertise-watcher.sh start|stop|status|consume`

#### Expertise Streamer Script (`scripts/expertise-streamer.sh`)
Real-time expertise streaming during active sessions.
- Injects updates IMMEDIATELY into running session (vs. queuing)
- Manual injection support: `./expertise-streamer.sh inject "message"`
- Usage: `./expertise-streamer.sh start|stop|status|inject|consume`

#### Deep Research Hook (`scripts/deep-research-hook.sh`)
10-minute timeout research hook for deep web scraping.
- Runs AFTER neural loop iterations
- Full article scraping (not just snippets)
- Cross-references multiple sources
- Queue format: `TOPIC|URL1,URL2,URL3`
- Results output to `.opencode/loop/research-results.md`

#### Wildcard Bash Permissions (`config/bash-permissions.yaml`)
Auto-approve safe command patterns for truly autonomous loops.
- Testing: pytest, npm test, vitest, jest
- Linting: eslint, prettier (check only)
- Git (read-only): status, diff, log, branch, show
- Claude scripts: `.opencode/scripts/*.sh` (with exclusions for destructive commands)
- Context-specific: extra approvals during neural-loop, tdd modes
- Deny patterns: rm -rf, force push, sudo, DROP DATABASE, etc.

### Changed

#### Session Start Script Enhancements
- **Layered Background Loading**: Load expertise, memory, and inbox items in background for faster startup
- **Agent Mesh Integration**: Consumes broadcast queue from expertise-watcher
- **Clickable Memory Navigation**: OSC 8 hyperlinks for inbox items and facts (clickable in terminal)

### Technical Details

These patterns leverage OpenCode v2.1.x features:
- `context: fork` - Isolated sub-agent contexts
- 10-minute hook timeouts (600s) - Deep research capability
- Wildcard bash permissions - Autonomous loop enablement
- OSC 8 hyperlinks - Terminal file navigation
- Unified Ctrl+B backgrounding - Background task management
- Skill hot-reload from ~/.config/opencode/skills

### Best Practices

**When to use each pattern:**

| Pattern | Use When |
|---------|----------|
| `/research-swarm` | Need broad coverage of a topic |
| `/pv-mesh` | Need fast multi-AI consensus |
| `/teleport-sync` | Moving between local and cloud Claude |
| Expertise Watcher | Setting up persistent learning |
| Deep Research Hook | Running extended research loops |

- **Anthropic Engineering** - Effective harnesses for long-running agents
- **Vercel v0** - Multi-system pipeline architecture

### Added

#### Enhanced `/loop-start` with new options
- **`--sandbox`** - Run in Docker container for AFK safety
- **`--type <type>`** - Loop types: feature, coverage, lint, entropy
- **`--init`** - Auto-run /loop-init before starting

#### New Specialized Loop Commands
- **`/loop-init`** - Initialize features.json and progress.txt before loops
  - Breaks task into discrete features with passes: true/false tracking
  - Creates structured progress file for inter-iteration memory
  - Runs health checks before starting work

- **`/loop-coverage`** - Test coverage improvement loop
  - Targets specific coverage percentage
  - Prioritizes critical code paths
  - One test per iteration for quality

  - Focus areas: unused, dead, patterns
  - Leaves codebase better than found

#### Key Principles (from Ralph Wiggum)
1. **Agent picks the task** - Define end state, not steps
2. **Progress file for memory** - Cheaper than re-exploring codebase
3. **Promise-based exit** - `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` pattern
4. **Single feature per iteration** - Prevents context exhaustion
5. **Small steps** - Context rot makes large tasks worse
6. **Prioritize risky tasks** - Architecture first, polish last
7. **Fight entropy** - Poor code leads to poorer code

#### New Files
- `.opencode/commands/loop-init.md` - Initialize loop artifacts
- `.opencode/commands/loop-coverage.md` - Coverage-focused loop
- `.opencode/commands/loop-lint.md` - Linting-focused loop
