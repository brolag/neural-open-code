## The Problem

Every OpenCode session starts from zero. You explain your project structure, conventions, and preferences... again and again.

## The Solution

Neural OpenCode remembers. It learns patterns, accumulates knowledge, and gets smarter over time.

```
Traditional: Execute -> Forget -> Repeat forever
Neural:      Execute -> Learn  -> Improve always
```

---

## Quick Start

**One command to install:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brolag/neural-open-code/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer will:
- Clone the repository
- Configure your shell
- Register all commands
- Set up hooks
- Offer to install recommended skills

**Then run the guided tour:**

```bash
/onboard
```

<details>
<summary>Manual installation</summary>

```bash

# 2. Setup
cd ~/Sites/neural-open-code && ./scripts/setup-hooks.sh

# 3. Add to shell
echo 'export OPENCODE_PLUGIN_ROOT="$HOME/Sites/neural-open-code"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# 4. Guided tour
/onboard
```
