# Workflow

Neural OpenCode exposes exactly five skills:

```text
/discover -> /spec -> approval -> /craft -> /vet + /exercise -> ship
```

## 1. Discover

Use `/discover` when the request hides architectural choices, unfamiliar code,
security boundaries, or expensive assumptions.

```text
/discover inspect this repository before we replace authentication
```

It writes `unknowns-map.md`, resolves architecture-changing questions, and
stops. Skip it for obvious low-risk work.

## 2. Spec

Use `/spec` to turn evidence into a build contract.

```text
/spec plan the approved authentication migration
```

`plan.md` locks interfaces, CWE-tagged invariants, dependency-aware subtasks,
and executable acceptance. Its initial status is `draft`; implementation waits
for explicit approval.

## 3. Craft

Use `/craft` after reviewing and approving the plan.

```text
/craft implement the plan we just approved
```

Craft captures a baseline, implements against locked signatures, verifies each
subtask, records deviations, and measures the final delta. It does not silently
commit, publish, deploy, or merge.

## 4. Vet

Use `/vet` as the independent pre-ship review.

```text
/vet --spec plans/2026-07-12-example/plan.md --scope working-tree
```

The reviewer receives a neutral bundle, actively searches for counterexamples,
checks every required criterion, and returns exactly `SHIP` or `HOLD`.

## 5. Exercise

Use `/exercise` to verify the public workflow after automated checks.

```text
/exercise --spec plans/2026-07-12-example/plan.md
```

Exercise drives the appropriate browser, desktop, CLI, installer, or docs
surface and captures direct evidence. It returns `PASS` or `FAIL`.

## Artifact lifecycle

```text
plans/<date>-<slug>/
├── unknowns-map.md   # when discovery is needed
├── plan.md           # source-of-truth contract
├── baseline.md       # before metrics
├── delta.md          # after metrics
├── vet-report.md     # independent review
└── exercise-report.md
```

Artifacts are append-friendly and reviewable. Do not store credentials,
personal data, machine-specific caches, or unredacted sensitive output in them.

## Choosing the smallest safe path

- Obvious edit: implement and test directly.
- Clear non-trivial change: `/spec -> /craft -> /vet -> /exercise`.
- Ambiguous or high-cost change: start with `/discover`.

The workflow adds gates based on uncertainty and consequence, not file count.
