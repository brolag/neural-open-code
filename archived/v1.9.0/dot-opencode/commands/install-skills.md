   - Detect current installation status

2. **Skill Selection**
   - Browse by category
   - Multi-select interface
   - View already-installed skills

3. **Dependency Resolution**
   - Auto-detect dependencies
   - Add missing dependencies to install list
   - Show dependency tree

4. **Installation**
   - Create target directories
   - Copy SKILL.md + references
   - Update registry
   - Log installation

5. **Validation**
   - Verify files copied
   - Check YAML frontmatter
   - Generate summary report

## Output Format

```markdown
## Installation Complete!

**Scope**: project
**Installed**: 5 skills

### Installed Skills ✓

- debugging
- tdd
- slop-scan
- slop-fix
- overseer

### Dependencies Added

- (none)

### Usage Examples

/debug          # debugging
/tdd            # tdd
/slop-scan      # slop-scan
/slop-fix       # slop-fix
/overseer       # overseer

### Next Steps

1. Use skills with their trigger commands
2. Run /help to see all available commands
3. Check AGENTS.md for project-specific configuration
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Prerequisites missing | bash 4+, jq, or python3 not installed | Install with: `brew install bash jq python3` |
| Registry not found | Plugin not properly initialized | Check plugin installation |
| Permission denied | Can't write to target directory | Check directory permissions |
| Skill source missing | Corrupted plugin installation | Re-clone plugin repository |

**Fallback**: If interactive mode fails, manually copy skills from plugin `skills/` directory to project `.opencode/skills/` directory.

## Implementation Details

### Skills Registry

Location: `.opencode/skills-registry.json`

Tracks:
- Available skills by category
- Skill metadata (name, description, trigger, dependencies)
- Installation status (project vs global)
- Recommendations

### Log Files

Location: `~/.config/opencode/setup/logs/install-{timestamp}.json`

Records:
- Installation timestamp
- Selected skills
- Installation scope
- Success/failure status
- Error messages

### Safety Features

- Idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- Dry-run mode for preview
- Automatic dependency resolution
- Rollback on failure
- Installation validation

## Integration

This command is part of the Neural OpenCode plugin system.

After installation, skills are immediately available for use through:
- Command triggers (e.g., `/debug`, `/slop-scan`)
- Automatic activation (e.g., React code triggers `react-best-practices`)
- Skill tool invocation
