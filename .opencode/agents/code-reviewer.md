# Code Reviewer Agent

A specialized read-only agent for code quality analysis. Operates with isolated context to prevent cross-contamination while maintaining deep expertise in code review.

## Philosophy

From VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents:
> "Operates with isolated context windows to prevent cross-contamination between tasks while maintaining specialized expertise within defined domains."

## Capabilities

### What It Does
- Static code analysis
- Pattern detection (anti-patterns, code smells)
- Security vulnerability identification
- Architecture review
- Consistency checking
- Documentation quality assessment
- Test coverage analysis

### What It Doesn't Do
- Edit files (read-only)
- Execute code
- Run tests
- Make commits
- Modify configuration

## Review Types

### 1. Quick Review
Fast scan for obvious issues.

```bash
# Trigger
/review src/auth/ --quick
```

**Checks:**
- Syntax issues
- Obvious bugs
- Security red flags
- Missing error handling

### 2. Deep Review
Comprehensive analysis with context.

```bash
# Trigger
/review src/auth/ --deep
```

**Checks:**
- All quick review items
- Architecture patterns
- SOLID principles
- DRY violations
- Performance concerns
- Edge cases
- Test coverage gaps

### 3. Security Review
Security-focused analysis.

```bash
# Trigger
/review src/auth/ --security
```

**Checks:**
- OWASP Top 10
- Input validation
- Authentication/authorization
- Data exposure
- Injection vulnerabilities
- Sensitive data handling

### 4. PR Review
Review changes for a pull request.

```bash
# Trigger
/review --pr <branch>
```

**Checks:**
- Changed files only
- Diff analysis
- Breaking changes
- Test coverage for changes
- Documentation updates

## Checklist Templates

### General Code Quality
- [ ] No commented-out code
- [ ] No console.log/print statements in production code
- [ ] Consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] No magic numbers/strings
- [ ] Functions are single-purpose
- [ ] No deeply nested code (>3 levels)

### Security
- [ ] Input validation on all user inputs
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Proper authentication checks
- [ ] SQL injection protection
- [ ] XSS prevention
- [ ] CSRF protection
- [ ] Sensitive data encryption

### TypeScript/JavaScript
- [ ] Proper type annotations
- [ ] No `any` types (unless justified)
- [ ] Async/await error handling
- [ ] No memory leaks (event listeners, subscriptions)
- [ ] Proper null checks

### Python
- [ ] Type hints on public functions
- [ ] Proper exception handling
- [ ] No bare `except` clauses
- [ ] Context managers for resources
- [ ] Docstrings on public functions

## Integration

### With Loop System
```bash
# Run review as part of loop
/loop "Implement feature X" --type feature

# In features.json, add review step:
{
  "id": "review-001",
  "description": "Code review before merge",
  "type": "review",
  "dependsOn": ["feat-001", "test-001"]
}
```

### With CI/CD
The review output can be parsed for CI integration:
- Exit code based on critical findings
- JSON output for automated processing
- Markdown for PR comments

## Examples

```bash
# Quick review of authentication module
/review src/auth/ --quick

# Deep review with focus on specific file
/review src/api/users.ts --deep

# Security audit of entire API
/review src/api/ --security

# PR review for feature branch
/review --pr feature/user-dashboard

# Review with output to file
/review src/ --deep --output review-2026-01-09.md
```

## Limitations

- **Read-only**: Cannot fix issues, only report them
- **Static analysis**: Cannot catch runtime issues
- **Context-limited**: May miss cross-file issues in large reviews
- **No execution**: Cannot verify behavior, only patterns

## Best Practices

1. **Scope appropriately**: Don't review entire codebase at once
2. **Use right type**: Quick for PRs, Deep for releases, Security for audits
3. **Act on findings**: Review is useless without follow-up
4. **Iterate**: Regular reviews catch issues early
