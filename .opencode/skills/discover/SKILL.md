description: Surface hidden requirements and architectural unknowns before planning non-trivial work. Use when a request is ambiguous, spans unfamiliar code, has meaningful tradeoffs, or needs a grounded blindspot pass before $spec. Produces an unknowns-map.md artifact and stops without implementing.

# Discover

Map the gap between the user's intent and the real repository before planning. Do not write implementation code.

Read `references/unknowns-framework.md` before running the workflow. It defines the four quadrants and artifact contract.

## 1. Right-size the gate

Skip discovery for an obvious, low-risk change with no architectural choice. Explain briefly that `$spec` or direct implementation is sufficient.

Use discovery when at least one is true:

- the relevant code or domain is unfamiliar;
- the request hides product, data, security, or compatibility choices;
- several references or systems must be reconciled;
- a wrong assumption would make the later build expensive to undo.

## 2. Ground the blindspot pass

Read repository guidance and the narrowest relevant implementation surface. Prefer `AGENTS.md`, architecture docs, nearby tests, related history, and concrete `path:line` evidence. Check external sources only when the request or unstable facts require them.

Return findings in four groups:

1. prior decisions and why the system looks this way;
2. hidden constraints and failure modes;
3. the local quality bar and reusable patterns;
4. expert questions the initial request did not expose.

Do not replace repository evidence with generic best-practice lists.

## 3. Build the four-quadrant map

Classify the evidence as:

- **Known knowns:** explicit goals and constraints.
- **Known unknowns:** questions already visible to the user or agent.
- **Unknown knowns:** tacit preferences, conventions, and recognition criteria revealed by examples or existing code.
- **Unknown unknowns:** newly discovered risks, dependencies, or decisions.

For every material item, record its source, impact, and whether it blocks planning.

## 4. Resolve architecture-changing questions

Ask only questions whose answers can change interfaces, data ownership, security boundaries, dependencies, rollout, or user-visible behavior. Ask a small focused batch, explain the tradeoff, and recommend a default when evidence supports one.

When the surface is unclear, ask whether the change:

- crosses a trust or data boundary (feeds OWASP ASVS / CWE in `$spec`);
- adds a new abstraction instead of reuse (feeds ISO/IEC 25010 maintainability);
- exposes or changes a user interface (feeds WCAG 2.2 AA).

Do not run those gates here. Record the answers so `$spec` can lock them.

Stop interviewing when remaining questions can be safely decided during planning or implementation. Never ask again for a decision already established by current evidence.

## 5. Pin references

Record the strongest available references in descending order:

1. existing source code or tests;
2. live components or working examples;
3. diagrams, specifications, or official documentation;
4. screenshots or prose descriptions.

State what each reference should influence. Never copy secrets, tokens, `.env` values, or sensitive output into the map.

## 6. Write the artifact and stop

Write only `plans/<YYYY-MM-DD-task-slug>/unknowns-map.md`. Constrain the slug to lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens, and keep the resolved path inside the repository's `plans/` directory.

Include:

- task and repository context;
- all four quadrants;
- blindspot findings with evidence;
- resolved decisions and their rationale;
- pinned references;
- remaining unknowns marked blocking or non-blocking;
- recommended next step: `$spec`, a small prototype, or stop.

Do not produce HTML. Do not modify application code. Present the Markdown artifact and stop so the user can inspect it before `$spec`.

## Usage Examples

- `$discover map the unknowns in replacing our auth provider`
- `$discover inspect this repo before we plan the new billing flow`
- `$discover compare the local workflow with the published harness`

## Done when

The unknowns map is grounded in evidence, architecture-changing questions are resolved or explicitly blocking, references are pinned, and no implementation edits were made.
